  title: 'What Is This?'
  desc: 'Basically: I got tired of seeing a reference to a USR in a weapon profile or unit rule, looking for it in Big Hefty Book A, only to go "oh, hang on, it is not in this book - it must be in Big Hefty Book B! That *is* inconvenient üòê". So I built this site to be both a <a href="/rules/" class="font-bold underline text-gray-900">consolidated index</a> and a <a href="/" class="font-bold underline underline-offset-2 text-gray-900">quick lookup tool</a>.'

Needless to say, this fan site is 100% unofficial, not endorsed by Games Workshop, and remains online only by their good graces (as well as that of their Legal Eagles). No claim is made over Games Workshop's copyrights, trademarks, or IP. This project is run for primarily my own benefit (read: laziness), and does not ask for or accept donations, payment, or other funding of any kind.
